for cryptopp, ntl, mpir; bash the *.get file and the cd into the directory and run ./configure(if there is one) and then make.


for MIRACL, bash the get script, 

then copy thirdparty/miracl_patch/big.h -> thirdparty/linux/Miracl/include/big.h
then copy thirdparty/miracl_patch/mirdef.hpp -> thirdparty/linux/Miracl/include/mirdef.h
then copy thirdparty/miracl_patch/mirdef.hpp -> thirdparty/linux/Miracl/include/mirdef.hpp

then copy thirdparty/miracl_patch/linux64_cpp-> thirdparty/linux/Miracl/source/linux64_cpp
then copy thirdparty/miracl_patch/big.cpp-> thirdparty/linux/Miracl/source/big.cpp

then bash the linux64_cpp script while in the source dir. you should get a miracl.a lib. lastly, we need to update the include directory to have the same mirdef.h file. so rm include/mirdef.h and then cp include/mirdef.hpp include/mirdef.h 



for boost, bash the .get script, then cd into boost. run ./bootstrap.sh then run ./b2 stage --with-system --with-thread link=static -mt  . lastly, move the boost/boost folder with the header files to be inside boost/includes, that we in the Makefile, the boost include directory is boost/includes/ with #include "boost/*.h" . i.e.

mkdir thirdparty/linux/boost/includes
cp -r thirdparty/linux/boost/boost thirdparty/linux/boost/includes/
